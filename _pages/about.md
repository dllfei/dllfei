Lei Deng received his B.E. degree and Ph.D. degree from University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, and Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2012 and 2017, respectively. He is currently a Postdoc working with Professor Yuan Xie at [Scalable Energy-Efficient Architecture Lab (SEAL)](https://seal.ece.ucsb.edu/), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA. His research interests include computer architecture, machine learning, brain-inspired computing, tensor analysis, and complex networks.

Dr. Deng has been involved in professional services such as serving as a Guest Associate Editor for *Frontiers in Neuroscience* and a PC member for *International Symposium on Neural Networks (ISNN)* 2019. He serves as a reviewer for a number of journals such as *IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)*, *IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence (TETCI)*, *IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems (TCDS)*, *ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems (TODAES)*, *IEEE Access*, *Journal of Imaging*, and conferences such as *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)*, *IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA)*, *IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)*, *IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications (ICIEA)*, *Chinese Automation Congress (CAC)*, etc.
